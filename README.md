The User Account Management System is designed to manage user information, transactions, and loans with a real-time dynamic UI. Each user has a unique ID, full name, PIN, and an individualized interest rate. A username is automatically generated for each user based on their full name. The system allows users to transfer money to others, request loans under specific conditions (with a 10% fee of the loan amount), close accounts, and view their full transaction history. The user interface enables users to easily distinguish between deposits and withdrawals, track their total balance, deposits, withdrawals, and earned interest.

The system works by generating unique usernames during account creation and storing user-specific details. Users can initiate transactions and loan requests, which are processed immediately with real-time updates in the UI. All transactions are logged and can be sorted in descending order, providing a clear financial overview. Additionally, users have full visibility of their total balance and other key metrics, ensuring an efficient and intuitive account management experience.
